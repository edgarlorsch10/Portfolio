						<h1>Who Am I?</h1>
						<p>Hello world, I am Edgar Lorsch, a passionate software devloper.</p>
						<p>Outside work, I am an Information Technology student at Machakos University set to graduate towards the end of 2025.</p>
						<p>I first got introduced to coding just before 2021 came to an end,that is in November.</p>
						<p>Coding was not my cup of tea till I discovered web development, in April of 2022.There was just something about it that ignited a passion, a desire to learn, to achieve, to grow.</p>
						<p>Ever since,I kept putting my best foot forward in being the best version of myself as a software developer, I always believe in giving everything my best, including coding.</p>
						<p>Other than coding, I enjoy peaceful time alone in my house and learning how to be the best version of me everyday,I learn to tackle various life challenges and live a dignified life.</p>
						<p>To the person reading this,feel free to reach out to me for work you need done,I would be more than happy to help, merci beaucoup.</p>
